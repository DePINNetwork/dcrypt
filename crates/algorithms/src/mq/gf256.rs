// TODO: Implement GF(2^8) and GF(16) arithmetic.
// This would include addition, multiplication, inversion, etc.
// For GF(2^8), a common irreducible polynomial is x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1.
// For GF(16), x^4 + x + 1 is common.
// Log/antilog tables or other methods can be used for multiplication/inversion.
