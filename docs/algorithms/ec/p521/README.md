# NIST P-521 (`secp521r1`) Elliptic Curve

This module provides a robust, constant-time implementation of the NIST P-521 elliptic curve, also known as `secp521r1`. It is designed for security and is a fundamental component for building higher-level cryptographic protocols like Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

P-521 is a prime-order curve that operates over a 521-bit prime field defined by the Mersenne prime `p = 2^521 - 1`. It offers a very high security level (approximately 256 bits) and is part of the NSA's Suite B (now CNSA) cryptography standards for protecting classified information.

## Security Focus

The primary design goal of this module is security against side-channel attacks. All cryptographic operations involving secret data, such as scalar multiplication with a private key, are implemented to execute in **constant time**. This ensures that the execution time and memory access patterns do not leak information about the secret values being processed.

## Core Primitives

The `p521` module provides the essential building blocks for Elliptic Curve Cryptography:

*   **`Point`**: Represents a point on the curve in affine `(x, y)` coordinates. It supports:
    *   Point addition and doubling.
    *   Serialization to both **uncompressed** (`0x04 || x || y`) and **compressed** (`0x02/0x03 || x`) formats as per SEC 1 standards.
    *   Deserialization with validation to ensure the point is on the curve.

*   **`Scalar`**: Represents an integer modulo the curve's group order `n`. This type is used for private keys and supports:
    *   Secure generation and modular arithmetic.
    *   Constant-time operations.

*   **`generate_keypair()`**: Securely generates a new P-521 key pair, consisting of a private key (`Scalar`) and a corresponding public key (`Point`).

*   **`scalar_mult()` and `scalar_mult_base_g()`**: Constant-time scalar multiplication. `scalar_mult_base_g` is optimized for the common operation of multiplying the standard generator point `G` by a scalar (i.e., deriving a public key). `scalar_mult` handles the general case of multiplying any curve point by a scalar, as required in ECDH.

*   **`kdf_hkdf_sha512_for_ecdh_kem()`**: A Key Derivation Function based on HKDF-SHA512. This function is essential for ECDH, transforming the raw shared secret (an elliptic curve point) into a cryptographically secure symmetric key suitable for encryption or authentication. SHA-512 is used as the underlying hash function to match the high security level of the P-521 curve.

## Usage Example: ECDH Key Exchange

Here is an example of how to perform a key exchange using the P-521 primitives. Alice and Bob generate their respective key pairs and use them to derive a shared symmetric key.

```rust
use dcrypt::algorithms::ec::p521;
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

fn main() -> Result<(), dcrypt_algorithms::error::Error> {
    // 1. Alice generates her P-521 key pair.
    let (alice_private_key, alice_public_key) = p521::generate_keypair(&mut OsRng)?;

    // 2. Bob generates his P-521 key pair.
    let (bob_private_key, bob_public_key) = p521::generate_keypair(&mut OsRng)?;

    // 3. Alice computes the shared secret using her private key and Bob's public key.
    let alice_shared_point = p521::scalar_mult(&alice_private_key, &bob_public_key)?;

    // 4. Bob computes the shared secret using his private key and Alice's public key.
    let bob_shared_point = p521::scalar_mult(&bob_private_key, &alice_public_key)?;

    // Both parties will arrive at the same point on the curve.
    assert_eq!(alice_shared_point, bob_shared_point);

    // 5. To get a symmetric key, they use the KDF on the x-coordinate of the shared point.
    // Both must use the same "info" string for domain separation.
    let ikm = alice_shared_point.x_coordinate_bytes();
    let info = Some(b"p521-ecdh-example".as_slice());

    let alice_derived_key = p521::kdf_hkdf_sha512_for_ecdh_kem(&ikm, info)?;
    let bob_derived_key = p521::kdf_hkdf_sha512_for_ecdh_kem(&ikm, info)?;

    // The final derived keys will be identical.
    assert_eq!(alice_derived_key, bob_derived_key);

    println!("P-521 ECDH key exchange successful!");
    println!("Derived Symmetric Key (first 16 bytes): {}", hex::encode(&alice_derived_key[..16]));

    Ok(())
}
```
