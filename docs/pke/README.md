# Public Key Encryption

Part of the DCRYPT library, this crate provides Public Key Encryption (PKE) schemes. It specifically contains implementations of the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES).

The library is designed with a focus on security, modularity, and `no_std` compatibility (with `alloc`), ensuring it can be used in a wide range of Rust projects, including those in constrained environments like embedded systems or WebAssembly.

## Features

*   **ECIES Implementations**: Provides ECIES using several standard NIST elliptic curves.
*   **Authenticated Encryption**: All schemes use an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) cipher to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of messages.
*   **Secure Key Derivation**: Utilizes HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) with various SHA-2 hash functions to derive strong symmetric keys from the elliptic curve shared secret.
*   **Modern AEAD Ciphers**: Employs `ChaCha20Poly1305` and `AES-256-GCM` for the symmetric encryption part of the ECIES protocol.
*   **`no_std` Support**: Fully compatible with `no_std` environments by using the `alloc` crate for necessary dynamic data structures.
*   **Consistent API**: Adheres to the `Pke` trait from `dcrypt-api`, providing a uniform interface for key generation, encryption, and decryption.

## Supported Schemes

The crate provides the following ECIES configurations, each corresponding to a specific NIST curve and a set of cryptographic primitives:

| Struct | Elliptic Curve | Key Derivation Function | AEAD Cipher |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EciesP192` | NIST P-192 | HKDF-SHA256 | ChaCha20Poly1305 |
| `EciesP224` | NIST P-224 | HKDF-SHA256 | ChaCha20Poly1305 |
| `EciesP256` | NIST P-256 | HKDF-SHA256 | ChaCha20Poly1305 |
| `EciesP384` | NIST P-384 | HKDF-SHA384 | AES-256-GCM |
| `EciesP521` | NIST P-521 | HKDF-SHA512 | AES-256-GCM |

## Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
dcrypt-pke = "0.12.0-beta.1"
# For random number generation, required for keypair generation and encryption
rand = "0.8"
```

## Usage Example

Here is a basic example of how to generate a keypair, encrypt a message, and then decrypt it using `EciesP256`.

```rust
use dcrypt::pke::EciesP256;
use dcrypt::api::traits::Pke;
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. A cryptographically secure random number generator is required.
    let mut rng = OsRng;

    // 2. Generate a keypair for the message recipient.
    let (public_key, secret_key) = EciesP256::keypair(&mut rng)?;

    // 3. Define a plaintext message and optional associated data (AAD).
    // AAD is authenticated but not encrypted.
    let plaintext = b"This is a secret message that must be kept confidential.";
    let aad = Some(b"Authenticated metadata".as_slice());

    // 4. Encrypt the message using the recipient's public key.
    // A fresh ephemeral keypair is generated for each encryption.
    println!("Encrypting message...");
    let ciphertext = EciesP256::encrypt(&public_key, plaintext, aad, &mut rng)?;

    // 5. The recipient uses their secret key to decrypt the message.
    println!("Decrypting message...");
    let decrypted_plaintext = EciesP256::decrypt(&secret_key, &ciphertext, aad)?;

    // 6. Verify that the decrypted message matches the original plaintext.
    assert_eq!(plaintext, decrypted_plaintext.as_slice());

    println!("\nSuccess! The original and decrypted messages match.");
    println!("Original:  {}", std::str::from_utf8(plaintext)?);
    println!("Decrypted: {}", std::str::from_utf8(&decrypted_plaintext)?);

    Ok(())
}```

## `no_std` Support

This crate is designed to work in `no_std` environments. To use it this way, you must disable the default features and enable the `alloc` feature in your `Cargo.toml`. This will replace the standard library dependency with the `alloc` crate.

```toml
[dependencies]
dcrypt-pke = { version = "0.12.0-beta.1", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
rand = { version = "0.8", default-features = false }
```
